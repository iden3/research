We generate the points $P_0,\dots,P_k$ described in section \ref{sec-ped} in such a manner that it is difficult to find a connection between any of these two points. More precisely, we take  
\texttt{D =  "Iden3$\_$PedersenGenerator$\_$"} followed by a byte \texttt{S} holding that smallest number that 
\texttt{H = Blake2s-256(D || S)} results in a point in the elliptic curve. We use the specification of Blake2s-256 hash function defined in \url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693#appendix-D}.

% TODO: Add what happens if $g_i = k \times g_{i+1}$? Show it is easy to invert the hash function?
