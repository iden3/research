We generate the points $P_0,\dots,P_{{5}}$ in such a manner that it is difficult to find a connection between any of these two points. 
More precisely, we take 
	\texttt{D =  "seed$\_$string$\_$"} 
followed by a byte 
	\texttt{S} 
holding that smallest number that 
	\texttt{H = Blake2s-256(D || S)} 
results in a point in the elliptic curve $E$. We use the specification of Blake2s-256 hash function defined in
\red{REF-LINK??}.
