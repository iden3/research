% Motivation: a section describing at least one concrete application motivating the proposed standard, including an explanation of why the community will benefit from such a standard.

The primary advantage of this Pedersen hash function is its efficiency.
The ability to compute the hash efficiently makes it an attractive proposal for use
within the circuits associated with zk-SNARK proofs \cite{efficiency}.
% Discussion about its efficiency inside circuits:

Having a standard, secure, and efficient hash function is one of the paramount aspect for implementing
usable, comprehensible, and easily verifiable zero knowledge proofs.
