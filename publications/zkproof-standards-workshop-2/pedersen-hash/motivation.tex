	Roughly speaking, the Pedersen hash is a secure hash function that maps a sequence of bits to a point in %a large subgroup of 
	an elliptic curve \cite{pedersen-gen}. The big advantage of % using 
	this hash is the fact that it is very efficient to compute inside a circuit, so it suits zk-SNARK very well [REF]. \\
	% Discussion about its efficiency inside circuits:

	The Pedersen hash has already been defined and used by the ZCash team in Sapling, their latest network upgrade \cite{sapling}. They construct it on Jubjub elliptic curve and using 3-bit lookup tables. In this document, we propose an implementation of the Pedersen hash function using Baby-Jubjub elliptic curve and 4-bit windows, which requires less constraints per bit than using 3-bit windows. \\
