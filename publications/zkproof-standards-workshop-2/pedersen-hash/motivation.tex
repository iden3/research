% Motivation: a section describing at least one concrete application motivating the proposed standard, including an explanation of why the community will benefit from such a standard.

{\color{purple} The primary advantage of the 4-bit window Pedersen hash function is it's efficiency. The ability to compute the hash efficiently makes it an attractive proposal for use within the circuits associated with zk-SNARK proofs \red{\bf [REF missing]}.}
% Discussion about its efficiency inside circuits:

{\color{purple} Having a standard, secure, and efficient hash function is one of the paramount aspect for implementing usable, comprehensible, and easily verifiable zero knowledge proofs.}
