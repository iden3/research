% Challenges: for motivating the discussions, highlight the main challenges in creating such a standard,
% as well as any open or unresolved questions.
One of the main challenges to create this standard and to see it adopted by the community is
to provide correct, usable, and well-maintained implementations in as many languages as possible.

Some effort is also required to audit and verify code coming from the community
and claiming to implement the 4-bit window Pedersen hash function
to prevent the propagation of potentially insecure implementations.

Finally, the proposal as it stands today includes the padding of the message $M$ to a multiple of four bits.
There are potentials issues with this approach where collisions can happen.

%For example, the sequences of bits \texttt{10000} and \texttt{10000000} will share the same hash
%as the former pre-image is padded to \texttt{10000000} which is identical to the latter pre-image.
%We were unable to confidently solve this issue in time for the submission deadline of the first draft,
%but this oversight will be solve before the final version is submitted.
