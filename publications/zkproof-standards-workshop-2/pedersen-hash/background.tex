% Background: a section introducing the problem, including definitions, references to previous work and other background details.

The Pedersen hash has already been defined and used by the ZCash team in Sapling,
their latest network upgrade \cite{sapling}.
They construct it on {\color{purple}the} Jubjub elliptic curve and using 3-bit lookup tables.
In this document, we propose a {\color{purple}different} implementation of the Pedersen hash function
using Baby-Jubjub elliptic curve and 4-bit windows, which requires less constraints per bit than using 3-bit windows.
