The 4-bit window Pedersen hash function is a secure hash function
which maps a sequence of bits to a point on an elliptic curve \cite{pedersen-gen}.

This proposal aims to standardise this hash function
for use primarily within the arithmetic circuits of zero knowledge proofs,
together with other generic uses such as for Merkle tree or any use cases requiring a secure hash function.

As part of the standard, the paper details the elliptic curve used for the hash function,
the process to compute the Pedersen hash from a given sequence of bits,
and the computation of the hash from a sequences of bits using an arithmetic circuit
---which can be used within zero knowledge proofs.

Moreover the paper contains references to open-source implementations of the 4-bit window Pedersen hash function
which follows the computation process details in this proposal.
