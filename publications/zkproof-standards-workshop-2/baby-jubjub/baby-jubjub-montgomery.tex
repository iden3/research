{\it{Baby-Jubjub}} is birationally equivalent to the Montgomery elliptic curve defined by  
	$$ E_M : v^2 = u^3 + 168698 u^2 + u. $$
The birational equivalence from $E$ to $E_M$ is the map 
	$$ (x,y) \to (u,v) = \left( \frac{1 + y}{1 - y} , \frac{1 + y}{(1 - y)x} \right) $$
with inverse from $E_M$ to $E$
	$$ (u, v) \to (x, y) = \left(  \frac{u}{v}, \frac{u - 1}{u + 1}   \right). $$
These results are from \cite[Theorem 3.2]{twisted}.
