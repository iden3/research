The search for an elliptic curve defined over the large prime subgroup of BN128 elliptic curve is motivated by its usefulness in zk-SNARK proofs. We wanted to find a in a deterministic way, so that it was clear no other considerations were taken for defining it. 
With this purpose, we used a deterministic algorithm for finding elliptic curves over a specified finite field together with the restrictions of security parameters of SafeCurves requirements. % requirements s%atisfiability of SafeCurves project. Baby-jubjub is the result of this combination. Baby Jubjub is the result of this research.

%For that, we used a deterministic algorithm done by a group of IRPF researchers in 2016 and EXPOSED IN PAGE SUCH OF \cite{generation-baby}. Baby-jubjub is the result of applying such algorithm.
