With this purpose, we used a deterministic algorithm for finding elliptic curves over a specified finite field \cite{generation-baby} together
with the restrictions of security parameters described in SafeCurves project \cite{safe-curves}. % requirements s%atisfiability of SafeCurves project. Baby-jubjub is the result of this combination. Baby Jubjub is the result of this research.
