We define the twisted Edwards curve {\it Baby-Jubjub} defined over $\Fp$ with 
	$$	p = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364
			400416034343698204186575808495617 $$
described by 
	$$	E: 168700 x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 168696 x^2 y^2. $$  

The order of $E$ is $8\times r$, where 
	$$	r = 2736030358979909402780800718157159386076813
			972158567259200215660948447373041. $$ 
The rest of specifications and the satisfiability of SafeCurves criteria  of this curve can be found in \cite{github-barry}.
