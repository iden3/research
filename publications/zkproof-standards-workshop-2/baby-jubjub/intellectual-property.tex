%	We aim to ensure that proposals can be freely implemented. Thus, proposals should disclose the existence of any known patents (awarded or pending) which may restrict free implementation. This may affect the decision process, and a detailed policy is being developed.
We will release the final version of this proposal under creative commons,
to ensure it is freely available to everyone.
